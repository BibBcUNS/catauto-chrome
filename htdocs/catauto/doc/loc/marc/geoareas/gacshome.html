</p><h3><a name="intro">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h3>
<p>This document contains a list of geographic areas and their associated one- 
  to seven-character codes. The list includes separate codes for countries, first 
  order political divisions of some countries, regions, geographic features, outer 
  space, and celestial bodies. The purpose of this list is to allow places reflected 
  in the subject headings assigned to an item to be designated by codes in the 
  MARC record for that item. <br>
  <br>
  The list contains 575 discrete codes, of which 51 are discontinued codes no 
  longer valid for use.This list was originally developed through the collaboration 
  of three former units of the Library of Congress: Research Services, MARC Development 
  Office, and Subject Cataloging Division. It is currently maintained by the Library 
  of Congress' Cataloging Policy and Support Office and Network Development and 
  MARC Standards Office.<br>
  <br>
  The list published here includes all valid and obsolete codes as of March 2003. 
  A list of all changes made in the 2002 printed edition is located at: <a href="gacs_chg.html">www.loc.gov/marc/geoareas/gacs_chg.html</a>. 
  Likewise, a list of changes made since the 2002 printed edition was published 
  is located at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/gacschg.html">www.loc.gov/marc/gacschg.html</a>. 
  These changes are added to the web-based code list 90 days after they are first 
  announced. They will also be incorporated in the new printed edition when it 
  is published.</p>

<h3>STRUCTURE OF THE CODES</h3>
The geographic area codes are seven-character strings, consisting of lowercase 
alphabetic letters and embedded or trailing hyphens. The code list shows only 
the alphabetic characters and embedded hyphens. The trailing hyphens that are 
added to codes shorter than seven characters for input into the MARC record are 
not shown in the list. <br>
The codes are constructed to provide a hierarchical arrangement of geographic 
and political entities. There are three levels possible in the codes. Most codes 
are at the first level and represent continents, regions, geographic features, 
and some national level political jurisdictions. A first level code consists of 
one or more lowercase alphabetic characters. For example, <br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="14%"> <strong>a</strong> </td>
    <td width="86%">Asia</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="14%"><b>ev</b></td>
    <td width="86%">Scandinavia</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="14%"><b>nwbf</b></td>
    <td width="86%">Bahamas</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
  <br>
A list of single character first level codes appears in Part III. The following 
seven first level entities are divided at the second level: <br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>a</b></td>
    <td width="85%">Asia</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>e</b></td>
    <td width="85%">Europe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>f</b></td>
    <td width="85%">Africa</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>i</b></td>
    <td width="85%">Indian Ocean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>n</b></td>
    <td width="85%">North America</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>s</b></td>
    <td width="85%">South America</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%"><b>u</b></td>
    <td width="85%">Australasia</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
Second level codes represent regions and national level political entities located 
within the entity represented by the first level code. A second level code consists 
of a first level code, followed by one hyphen, followed by the code for the second 
level entity. At the second level, a two letter code generally represents a country, 
and a three letter code represents a region within a country. For example, <br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>e-sw</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Sweden</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>n-cn</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Canada</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>n-cnm</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Maritime Provinces</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
The following five second level entities are divided at the third level: <br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>a-cc</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">China</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>n-us</strong> </td>
    <td width="84%">United States</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>e-uk</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Great Britain</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>u-at</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Australia</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>n-cn</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Canada</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
Third level codes represent first order political divisions of countries represented 
by a second level code. A third level code consists of a first level code, one 
hyphen, a second level code, one hyphen, and a third level code. Third level codes 
always consist of two lowercase alphabetic characters. For example, <br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="17%"><strong>a-cc-hu</strong></td>
    <td width="83%">Hunan Sheng (China)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%"><strong>n-cn-on</strong></td>
    <td width="83%">Ontario</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%"><strong>e-uk-st</strong></td>
    <td width="83%">Scotland</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%"><strong>n-us-ky</strong></td>
    <td width="83%">Kentucky</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%"><strong>u-at-qn</strong></td>
    <td width="83%">Queensland </td>
  </tr>

<h3>ARRANGEMENT OF THE LIST</h3>
The geographic area code list is made up of four parts: Part I: Name Sequence, 
Part II: Code Sequence, Part III: Places Represented by Single Character Codes, 
and Appendix A: Changes. All names in the code list match headings established 
in the Library of Congress name authority file for jurisdictions and the Library 
of Congress Subject Headings for continents, regions, and geographic features. 
Descriptions of the four parts of the code list follow: 
<h3> <u>Part I: Name Sequence</u></h3>
<p>In this part, the places are listed alphabetically by the name. An entry for 
  a place with a unique code gives the name followed by the code in brackets, 
  both in boldface. Any variant names of the place are listed on successive lines, 
  with the first variant preceded by the symbol UF (used for). For example: <br>
</p>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top"> 
    <td height="23" colspan="3"><strong>Guyana [s-gy]</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="13%"> </td>
    <td width="9%">UF </td>
    <td width="78%">British Guiana </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The entry for a place which does not have a unique code, but is assigned a 
  code for another place, is similar except that the assigned code with its associated 
  place name is given on the lines following the name. For example: <br>
</p>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3"><strong>Austral Islands (French Polynesia)</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td colspan="2"><i>Assigned code</i>: <strong>[pofp]</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3">French Polynesia </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td width="10%">UF </td>
    <td width="76%">Tubuai Islands (French Polynesia) </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The UF names from each of these entries also appear in their alphabetic position 
  in the list as references, but <strong>not</strong> in boldface. These references 
  do not give the code; the entry under the name referred to must be consulted 
  to determine the code. For example: <br>
</p>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3">Tubuai Islands (French Polynesia) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="10%"> </td>
    <td colspan="2">USE Austral Islands (French Polynesia) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3">British Guiana </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="10%"> </td>
    <td width="12%">USE </td>
    <td width="78%">Guyana </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Entries may also include a note in italics explaining a change in the use of 
  codes. For example: <br>
</p>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3"> 
      <p><strong>Mayotte [i-my]</strong> </p>

  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td colspan="2"><em>[Coded [i-cq] (Comoros) before Mar. 1988]</em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3"><strong>Barbuda</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td height="18" width="14%"> </td>
    <td height="18" colspan="2"><em>[Coded [nwbc] (Barbuda) before Mar. 1988]</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td height="18" width="14%"> </td>
    <td height="18" colspan="2"><em>Assigned code:</em> <strong>[nwaq]</strong> 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3">Antigua and Barbuda Northwest (U.S.) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td colspan="2"><em>[Coded [n-usw] (Northwest (U.S.)) before Mar. 1988]</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td height="21" width="14%"> </td>
    <td height="21" width="11%">USE </td>
    <td height="21" width="75%">Northwest, Pacific </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Unusual situations may require additional notes. </p>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="3"><strong>Germany (East) [e-ge]</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td colspan="2"><em>[For the eastern part of Germany before 1949 or after 
      1990 and for the German Democratic Republic between 1949-1990]</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td width="9%">UF</td>
    <td width="77%">Democratic German <br>
      Republic East Germany <br>
      German Democratic Republic <br>
      Germany, Eastern </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>See the section "Changes in the Codes" below for more information about these 
  notes. 
</p><h3> <u>Part II: Code Sequence</u></h3>
In this part, the places and their codes are listed alphabetically by the code. 
Only the code and the name of the place are given in this part. Tracings or references 
for variant forms of the place names are not included. For example: <strong><br>
<br>
</strong> 
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>e-rm</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Romania</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>pofp</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">French Polynesia</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>s-gy</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Guyana</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong><br>
</strong> Discontinued codes are also listed in this part in their alphabetical 
sequence. They are identified by a hyphen preceding the code. For example: <br>
  
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>-pogn</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Gilbert and Ellice Islands</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="16%"><strong>-a-sk</strong></td>
    <td width="84%">Sikkim</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
Places which are assigned the code for another place, rather than a unique code, 
are not included in the code sequence part. Thus, the place Austral Islands which 
is assigned the code <em>pofp</em> does not appear in this part of the list. 
<h3> <u>Part III: Places Represented by Single Character Codes</u></h3>
This part contains a list of all places represented by a single character code, 
along with the code. The hierarchical arrangement of places and assignment of 
codes is based on these first level regions. 
<h3> <u>Appendix A: Changes</u></h3>
<p>This part contains a list of code changes from the 2000 edition. <br>

<hr>
<h3><strong>APPLICATION OF THE CODES</strong></h3>
<p>Geographic area codes are assigned in bibliographic records to bring out by 
  code the geographic areas that appear or are implied in the headings assigned 
  to the work being cataloged. Generally, codes are assigned for headings in a 
  subject added entry for a geographic name (field 651) or headings in other fields 
  which contain a geographic subdivision (subfield $z). Codes are also assigned 
  for headings representing ethnic groups, nationalities, civilizations, topics 
  qualified by ethnic groups or nationalities, individual named entities including 
  corporate bodies, and events. <br>
  Geographic area codes may be included in authority records for geographic areas 
  associated with the established heading of the record.The following guidelines 
  describe application of the codes in specific situations. <em><br>
  <br>
  Geographic entities (General).</em> The appropriate code for a geographic feature, 
  region, or jurisdiction is assigned, if such a code exists. <em><br>
  <br>
  Local entities.</em> For a local geographic feature, region, or jurisdiction, 
  the appropriate code for the country or first order political division in which 
  the entity is located is assigned. Separate codes for the first order political 
  divisions of the following countries have been provided: Australia, Canada, 
  China, Great Britain, and the United States. Codes have also been provided for 
  some individual regions within Russia (Federation). For any work dealing with 
  one of these regions as a whole, the indicated code is assigned. For an entity, 
  such as a city, located within one of these regions, the code for the corresponding 
  republic is assigned instead. <em><br>
  <br>
  Entities located in several countries.</em> For an entity located in several 
  countries, codes are assigned for each country, or for a larger encompassing 
  region. If an entity is located in several first order political divisions, 
  for countries having separate codes for political divisions, codes are assigned 
  for each division. <em><br>
  <br>
  Historic jurisdictions, empires, kingdoms, etc.</em> Codes are assigned that 
  correspond to modern-day jurisdictions or areas, generally coding for the greatest 
  territorial extent of these entities. For works that discuss a jurisdiction 
  during a period when its territory was more limited and for works focusing on 
  a specific location within a historical jurisdiction, the appropriate code for 
  the particular place is assigned. <em><br>
  <br>
  Parts of regions.</em> When a work deals with both a large geographic region 
  for which a specific code exists and a locality within the region, code for 
  both the region and the locality. If a single, specific code does not exist 
  for the region, code only for the part of the region covered by the work. <em><br>
  <br>
  Multiple area orientation.</em> When a work deals with several geographical 
  locations, a code is assigned for each or for a larger encompassing region. 
  <em><br>
  <br>
  Ethnic groups, nationalities, civilizations, etc.</em> Codes are assigned for 
  the jurisdictions or areas where ethnic groups, etc. are located. For an individual 
  element in the population, a code is assigned only for the present locality, 
  not the place of origin, as long as the people are citizens or permanent residents. 
  <em><br>
  <br>
  Foreign members of a population.</em> Codes are assigned for both the place 
  of origin and current location of peoples who are in an area other than their 
  permanent homeland, including travelers, temporary residents, aliens, and foreign 
  students. <em><br>
  <br>
  Influence of one nation on another.</em> For the impact of one place on another, 
  codes are assigned for both places. <em><br>
  <br>
  Special topics modified by names of ethnic groups or nationalities.</em> A code 
  is assigned for the jurisdiction or areas where the ethnic group or nationality 
  is located. If the work is limited to a special locality, a code is assigned 
  only for that locality. If the work deals with an area outside of the area normally 
  associated with the people, codes are assigned for both places. <em><br>
  <br>
  Language.</em> When assigning a code for language (usually only if the work 
  deals with geographic aspects of the language), a code is assigned for the location 
  of the language. No code is assigned to grammars, textbooks for learning a language, 
  histories of linguistic changes such as changes in phonology, etc. No code is 
  assigned to a work if the subject heading assigned is intended to bring out 
  the language of a publication. <em><br>
  <br>
  Named entities.</em> Codes are assigned for the location of individual named 
  entities, including corporate bodies, buildings and structures, roads, waterways, 
  railroads, monuments, camps, parks, gardens, etc. For government agencies, codes 
  are assigned for the jurisdictions the agencies serve. <em><br>
  <br>
  Events, exhibitions, movements, etc.</em> A code is assigned for the location 
  of the occurrence. <em><br>
  <br>
  Biography and genealogy.</em> Codes are assigned to works of biography (individual 
  or collective) and to works of genealogy, for the location of the individual, 
  group, or family if geographic areas are localized.<br>

<h3> <strong>CHANGES IN THE CODES</strong></h3>
This list provides codes for places existing at the time the list was compiled. 
The names of the places are also those current at the time of compilation. Changes 
in the status of places as well as changes in names are reflected in revised versions 
of this list. The following discusses how such changes are presented in the list.When 
a place has changed its name, the existing code is retained but the new name is 
used and the earlier name is added as a reference. For example:<br>
<br>
<table border="0" width="50%">
  <tbody><tr> 
    <td colspan="3"><strong>Sri Lanka [a-ce]</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td width="11%">UF </td>
    <td width="75%">Ceylon </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td colspan="3"> 
      <p>  Ceylon 
    </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="14%"> </td>
    <td width="11%">USE</td>
    <td width="75%">Sri Lanka </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>When it becomes necessary to change a code because the status of an entity 
  has changed, notes are added to the list to explain the code changes and the 
  date the change was made. If the old code is discontinued, it is retained in 
  the code list for information.<br>
  <br>
  The code for the latest name (the new code) should be used in all new records. 
  The old code, however, will not always be changed in previously input records. 
  Thus when using geographic area codes to retrieve records, if the code for the 
  entity has changed since the implementation of an earlier code list, it is advisable 
  to specify both the new and previously assigned (historical) codes in the retrieval 
  request if records coded prior to the changes are desired. <strong><br>
  <br>
  Example:</strong> One entity assigned a single code splits into two or more 
  separate entities. In this case, each of the new entities is assigned a new 
  code, and the code for the older combined entity is discontinued. Notes are 
  also added to each entity indicating the date of the code change. <br>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> One entity previously assigned a code is annexed 
  by another entity which is already assigned a different code, e.g., Sikkim was 
  annexed by India. In this case, the code for the annexed entity is discontinued, 
  and the annexed entity is assigned the code for the annexing entity. </p>
