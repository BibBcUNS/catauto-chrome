Sequence</em></a></h1>
<hr>
<h2>Arrangement of the List</h2>
<p>In the Term Sequence, the relator terms are listed alphabetically
by the term.  An alphabetic listing by code is provided in a
separate <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html">Code Sequence</a> list. 
An entry for a term to which a code has been assigned includes the term
followed by the code in brackets, both in boldface.  In many cases, a
definition in italics follows the relator term.  Following the
definition, any variants of the term are listed on successive lines,
with the first variant preceded by the symbol
<small>UF</small>
("used for"). For example:

</p><dl><dt><b>Censor   [cns]</b>
</dt><dd><i>Use for a censor, bowdlerizer,
expurgator, etc., official or private.</i>
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small>
</dt><dd>Bowdlerizer</dd><dt></dt><dd>Expurgator</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>The UF terms from each entry also appear in their alphabetic position in
the list as references, but
<u>not</u> in boldface.  These
references do not give the code. The entry under the term referred to must
be consulted to determine the code.  For example:

</p><dl><dt>Bowdlerizer
</dt><dd>
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small>
</dt><dd>Censor</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Expurgator
</dt><dd>
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small>
</dt><dd>Censor</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>Entries may also include a note in [brackets] explaining a change in the use
of codes. For example:
</p><dl><dt>Graphic technician
</dt><dd>
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small>
</dt><dd>Artist</dd></dl>
</dd><dd><i>[Coded [grt] (Graphic technician) before
