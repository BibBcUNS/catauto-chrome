<h2><a name="relaintr">General Introduction</a></h2>
This document contains several lists of codes intended for use in MARC 21 Authority, 
Bibliographic, Classification, Community Information, and Holdings records. The 
lists contain over 500 discrete codes, several of which are obsolete. Some codes 
appear on more than one list. The document is arranged for use in seven main parts; 
a brief description of these parts follows. 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><a href="relators.html">Relator Codes.</a></dt><dd> Part I contains a list of relator terms and their associated codes. The 
    purpose of this list is to allow the relationship between a name and a work 
    to be designated by codes in the MARC record.</dd><dt><a href="relacats.html">Category Code Sources.</a></dt><dd> Part II contains a list of works that are sources of codes which categorize 
    a bibliographic item.</dd><dt><a href="relaclas.html">Classification Sources.</a></dt><dd> Part III contains a list of sources of classification schemes for government 
    documents and a other types of publications.</dd><dt><a href="relasour.html">Term, Name, Title Sources.</a></dt><dd>Part IV contains a list of works that are sources of terms, names, and titles 
    used as headings or for indexing of authors, subjects, etc.</dd><dt><a href="relaform.html">Format Sources.</a></dt><dd>Part V contains a list of works that are sources of machine-readable cataloging 
    formats.</dd><dt><a href="reladesc.html">Description Convention Codes.</a></dt><dd>Part VI contains a list of codes assigned to sources of conventions (that 
    is, rules, manuals, guidelines, policies, etc.) that are used in the description 
    of bibliographic items. The codes in this list are used to identify the description 
    conventions applied in a MARC record as a whole, or to specific MARC elements 
    (e.g., particular fields).</dd><dt><a href="relaothr.html">Other Sources.</a></dt><dd>Part VII contains various lists of codes assigned to be used to identify 
    sources of data in MARC fields or to characterize the data in the MARC field. 
    The codes are recorded in subfield $2 of the MARC variable field to which 
    they apply. The code lists grouped here do not fit into any of the existing 
    groupings of codes in Parts I-VI.</dd></dl>
<p>This Web document includes all MARC relator and source codes that have been 
  assigned by the Library of Congress as the result of an official request. For 
  newly assigned codes only, a date is given before which the code should not 
  be included in exchange records. The date represents a 60-day waiting period 
  which is required to allow MARC implementers time to add newly assigned codes 
  to any validation tables they may use to check the codes recorded in certain 
  MARC data elements. MARC implementers may use newly assigned codes in their 
  internally systems immediately as long as records containing new codes are not 
  distributed until after the waiting period.<br>

<h3>Structure of the Codes</h3>
<p>Information about the structure of the codes for a particular list is presented 
  at the beginning of the corresponding part. The MARC codes listed in this publication 
  use only lower case alphabetic characters, and in some cases, numeric characters 
  0 through 9. No code exceeds the maximum of eight characters in length. Some 
  codes are limited to less than eight characters (for example, relator codes 
  are always three characters).</p>
<h3><b>Code Maintenance</b></h3>
<p>The Library of Congress is the maintenance agency for the lists in this document. 
  Requests for the assignment of new codes and questions about existing code assignments 
  should be sent to the: Network Development and MARC Standards Office, Library 
  of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC 20540-4402; Fax: 
  +1-202-707-0115; Email: <a href="mailto:ndmso@loc.gov">ndmso@loc.gov</a>. Requests 
  for the assignment of a new code should include a description of the term (for 
  relator codes) or a full bibliographic citation of the source (for codes assigned 
  to classification schemes, name/terms sources, description conventions, etc.). 
  If available, a photocopy of the title page for a printed source should be faxed 
  along with the request. If a source to which a code is being assigned is only 
  available online, the URL for the source can be used in place of a photocopy 
  of title page.</p>
<p>Notices announcing additions or changes to assigned codes and their related 
  citations are made public prior to the date they should be used in records in 
  <i>MARC News and Announcements</i> at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">www.loc.gov/marc/</a>.</p>
