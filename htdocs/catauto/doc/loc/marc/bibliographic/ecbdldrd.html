<p><u>Information for Translators and Other Users</u><br>
  Items highlighted in <font color="#ff0000">red</font> indicate changes made after the 2002 edition of the

</p><hr><h2><a name="mrcblea">LEADER</a>
</h2>
<p>A fixed field that comprises the first 24 character positions
(00-23) of each record and provides information for the
processing of the record.
</p><h3>Character Positions</h3>

<ul>
<li>00-04 - Record length<br>The computer-generated, five-character numeric string
that specifies the length of the entire record.  The number is
right justified and each unused position contains a
zero.</li><li>05 - Record status<br>Indicates the relation of the
record to a file.
<ul>
<li>a - Increase in encoding level<br>The Encoding level (Leader/17) of the record has
been changed to a higher encoding level.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>c - Corrected or revised<br>A change other than in the Encoding level code has
been made to the record.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>d - Deleted</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>n - New</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>p - Increase in encoding level from
prepublication<br>The cataloging level of a prepublication record has
changed because of the availability of the published
item.</li></ul>
</li><li>06 - Type of record<br>Indicates the characteristics
of and defines the components of the record.
<ul>
<li>a - Language material<br>Includes printed, microform, and electronic language material.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>c - Notated music<br>Includes microform and electronic notated music.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>d - Manuscript notated music<br>Includes microform manuscript music.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>e - Cartographic material<br>Includes maps, atlases, globes, digital maps, and other cartographic items.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>f - Manuscript cartographic material<br>Includes microform manuscript maps.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>g - Projected medium<br>Examples include: motion pictures,
videorecordings (including digital video), filmstrips, slides,
transparencies, or material specifically designed for projection.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>i - Nonmusical sound
recording<br>Examples include:  speech.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>j - Musical sound
recording<br>Examples include: phonodiscs, compact discs, or cassette tapes.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>k - Two-dimensional nonprojectable
graphic<br>Examples include:  activity cards,
charts, collages, computer graphics, drawings, duplication
masters, flash cards, paintings, photonegatives, photoprints,
pictures, photo CDs, postcards, posters, prints, spirit masters, study
prints, technical drawings, photomechanical reproductions, and reproductions of any of these.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>m - Computer file<br>Includes the following classes of electronic resources: computer
software (including programs, games, fonts), numeric data,
computer-oriented multimedia, online systems or
services. For these classes of materials, if there is a
significant aspect that causes it to fall into another
Leader/06 category, the code for that significant aspect
is used instead of code m (e.g., vector data that is
cartographic is not coded as numeric but
cartographic). Other classes of electronic resources
are coded for their most significant aspect (e.g.,
language material, graphic, cartographic material,
sound, music, moving image). In case of doubt or if the
most significant aspect cannot be determined, consider
the item a computer file.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>o - Kit<br>Contains a mixture of components
from two or more types of items, none of which is the
predominant constituent of the kit.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>p - Mixed material<br>Indicates that there are significant
materials in two or more forms that are usually related by virtue of
their having been accumulated by or about a person or body. Includes
archival fonds and manuscript collections of mixed forms of materials,
such as text, photographs, and sound recordings.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>r - Three-dimensional artifact or
naturally occurring object<br>Includes

</li><li>07 - Bibliographic level<br>Indicates the bibliographic
level of the record.
<ul>
<li>a - Monographic component part<br>A monographic bibliographic unit
that is physically
attached to or contained in another unit such that
the retrieval of the component part is dependent on the identification
and location of the host item or container. The record contains fields
that describe the component part and data that identify the host, field
773 (Host Item Entry).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>b - Serial component part<br>A serial bibliographic unit that is physically
attached to or contained in another serial unit such that the
retrieval of the component part is dependent on the physical
identification and location of the host item or container.  The
record contains fields that describe the component part and data
that identify the host, field 773 (Host Item Entry).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>c - Collection<br>A made-up multipart group of items that were not
originally published, distributed, or produced together.  The

contains fields that describe the subunit and data that identify
the Host Item Entry (field 773).</li></ul>

bibliographic information and/or content designation of the
MARC record.

item.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>1 - Full level, material not
examined<br>The information used in creating the record is
derived from an extant description of the item without

explicit information in the description.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>2 - Less-than-full level, material not
examined<br>The information used in creating the record is
derived from an extant description of the item without
reinspection of the physical item.  This code is used primarily

descriptive access points but only a specified subset of other
data elements are transcribed.  Authoritative headings may not
be current.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>3 - Abbreviated level<br>Indicates a brief record that does not meet the National Level
Bibliographic Record minimal level cataloging specifications.

record.</li></ul>
</li><li>18 - Descriptive cataloging form<br>Indicates the descriptive

follow International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD)
cataloging and punctuation provisions.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>a - AACR 2<br>The descriptive portion of the record and the choice
and form of entry of the access points are formulated according
to either the second edition of the
<em>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules</em> or cataloging
manuals based on AACR 2.  The punctuation practices of ISBD
apply.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>i - ISBD<br>The descriptive portion of the record is formulated

Leader/18 cannot determine the appropriate descriptive
cataloging form used in the record.  Code u may be used in records converted from another metadata format.</li></ul>

containing basic identification information (i.e., main entry
and title, main entry and uniform title, main entry under
uniform title, title, uniform title, Standard Technical Report
Number, or report number) can be generated from a Linking Entry
field (76X-78X).

<p></p><hr><h2><a name="mrcbdir">DIRECTORY</a>
</h2>
<p>A computer-generated index to the location of the variable
control and data fields within a record.  The Directory
immediately follows the Leader at character position 24 and
consists of a series of fixed-length (12 character positions)
entries that give the tag, length, and starting character
position of each variable field.
</p><h3>Character Positions</h3>

<ul>
<li>00-02 - Tag<br>Three numeric or alphabetic (uppercase or lowercase, but
not both) characters that identify an associated
field.</li><li>03-06 - Field length<br>Four numeric characters that indicate the length of the
field, including indicators, subfield codes, data, and the field
terminator.  The number is right justified and each unused
position contains a zero.</li><li>07-11 - Starting character position<br>Five numeric characters that indicate the starting
character position of the field relative to the Base address of
data (Leader/12-16) of the record.  The number is right
