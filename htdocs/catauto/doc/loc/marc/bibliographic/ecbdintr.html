<h1><em>MARC 21 Concise Bibliographic: Introduction </em></h1>
<hr><p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</em> is designed
to be a carrier for bibliographic
information about printed and manuscript textual materials, computer files, maps, music, continuing resources,
visual
materials, and mixed materials.  Bibliographic data commonly includes titles, names, subjects,
notes,
publication data, and information about the physical description of an item.  The bibliographic
format
contains data elements for the following types of material:
</p><dl><dt><strong>Books</strong></dt><dd>textual material that is monographic in
nature.</dd><dt><strong>Continuing resources</strong></dt><dd>textual items with a recurring
pattern of publication, e.g., periodicals, newspapers,
yearbooks.  (<strong>Note</strong>:  Prior to 2002, continuing resources were referred to as serials.)</dd><dt><strong>Computer files</strong></dt><dd>used for computer
software, numeric data,  computer-oriented multimedia,
online systems or services.  Other classes of  electronic resources are coded for their most
significant aspect.  Material  may be monographic or serial in
nature.</dd><dt><strong>Maps</strong></dt><dd>all types of cartographic materials,
including sheet maps and globes in printed, manuscript, electronic, and microform.</dd><dt><strong>Music</strong></dt><dd>printed and manuscript notated music.</dd><dt><strong>Sound recordings</strong></dt><dd>nonmusical sound recordings, and musical sound recordings.</dd><dt><strong>Visual materials</strong></dt><dd>projected media,
two-dimensional graphics, three-dimensional artifacts or
naturally occurring objects, and kits.  Used for archival visual materials when format or medium
is being emphasized.</dd><dt><strong>Mixed materials</strong></dt><dd>primarily
archival and manuscript collections of a mixture of forms of material. 
Material may be monographic or serial in nature</dd></dl>
<p></p><hr><h2>Kinds of Bibliographic Records</h2>
<p>MARC bibliographic records are distinguished from all other types of MARC records by
specific codes in Leader/06 (Type of record) which identifies the following bibliographic record
types.</p><table>
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="290"><br>
  Language (textual) material</td>
<td width="407"><br>

<tr valign="top"><td><br>

<td><br>

<p></p><hr><h2>Fill Character</h2>
<p>A fill character (hexadecimal value '7C'), represented in this document and ASCII as a
vertical
bar (|), may be used in bibliographic records in some positions in fields 006, 007 and 008, and
subfield $7 of the linking entry fields (760-787).  A fill character may not be used anywhere in
the leader, or in tags, indicators, or subfield codes.  The use of the fill character in records
contributed to a national database may also be dependent upon the national level requirements
specified for each data element.  The presence of a fill character in a bibliographic record
indicates that the format specifies a code to be used but the creator of the record has decided
not to attempt to supply a code.</p><p><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></p>
<p></p><hr><h2>Typographical Conventions</h2>
<p>Throughout this document, the following typographical conventions are used:
0 - The graphic 0 represents the digit zero in tags, fixed-position
character position citations, and indicator positions.  This character is distinct
from an uppercase
letter O used in examples or text.
</p><dl><p>0 - The graphic 0 represents the digit zero in tags, fixed-position character
    position citations, and indicator positions. This character is distinct from
    an uppercase letter O used in examples or text.
  </p><p> # - The graphic symbol # is used for a blank (hex 20) in coded fields and
    in other special situations where the existence of the character blank might
    be ambiguous.
  </p><p>$ - The graphic symbol $ is used for the delimiter (hex 1F) portion of a
    subfield code. Within the text, subfield codes are referred to as <em>subfield
    $a</em>, for example.
  </p><p>/ - Specific character positions of fixed-length data elements, such as
    those in the Leader, Directory, and field 008, are expressed using a slash
    and the number of the character position, e.g., Leader/06.
  </p><p><font color="#ff0000">1 - The graphic 1 represents the digit one (hex 31). This character must
    be distinguised from a lowercase roman alphabet letter l (el) and the uppercase
    alphabetic letter I (eye) in examples or text.
  </font>    </p><p>| - The graphic | represents a fill character (hex 7C).</p></dl>

<p></p><hr><h2>Organization of the Electronic Version of the Concise Format</h2>
<p>This electronic concise format is organized into parts that
generally mirror the tabbed sections of the full printed format
documentation. Each part is divided into chapters that usually
cover a single field and all of the data elements possible within it
(that is, character positions for
fixed-length fields and indicators and subfield codes for variable
length fields). The Leader and
the Directory are described in the first main part, followed by parts
containing the variable
control fields and variable data fields arranged in numerical field tag
order.</p><p>Obsolete and deleted content designators are not listed.  They are found in the full printed
version of the format and in the electronic MARC field lists.
