</p><h3><a name="general_intro">GENERAL INTRODUCTION</a></h3>
<p>The <i>MARC 21 Concise Formats</i> are officially 
  published online once a year (usually in October through December). It uses <font color="#ff0000">red</font> highlights
  to indicate changes made from the previous published edition. 
</p><p>The MARC 21 formats are widely used standards for the representation and exchange
  of authority, bibliographic, classification, community information, and holdings
  data in machine-readable form. They consist of a family of five coordinated
  formats: <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em>; <em>MARC 21 Format for
  Bibliographic Data</em>; <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em>; <em>MARC
  21 Format for Community Information</em>; and <em>MARC 21 Format for Holdings
  Data</em>. Each of these MARC formats is published separately to provide detailed
  field descriptions, guidelines for applying the defined content designation
  (with examples), and identification of conventions to be used to insure input
  consistency. The <em>MARC 21 Concise Formats</em> provide in a single publication
  a quick reference guide to the content designators defined in each MARC format.
  It provides a concise description of each field, each character position of
  the fixed-length data element fields, and of the defined indicators in the
  variable data fields. Descriptions of subfield codes and coded values are given
  only when their names may not be sufficiently descriptive. Examples are included
  for each field.
</p><h3>COMPONENTS OF A MARC 21 RECORD</h3>
<p>MARC format characteristics that are common to all of the formats are described 
  in this general introduction. Information specific only to certain record types 
  is given in the introduction to the MARC format to which it relates. 
</p><p>A MARC record is composed of three elements: the record structure, the content 
  designation, and the data content of the record. The <strong>record structure</strong> 
  is an implementation of the <em>American National Standard for Information Interchange</em> 
  (ANSI/NISO Z39.2) and its ISO equivalent ISO <font color="#ff0000">2709</font>. 
  The <strong>content designation</strong>--the tags, codes, and conventions established 
  explicitly to identify and further characterize the data elements within a record 
  and to support the manipulation of that data are defined by each of the MARC 
  formats. The <strong>content</strong> of the data elements that comprise a MARC 
  record is usually defined by standards outside the formats, such as the <em>International 
  Standard Bibliographic Description</em> (ISBD), <em>Anglo-American Cataloguing 
  Rules</em>, 2nd edition (AACR 2), <em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em> 
  (LCSH), <em>Holdings Statements Summary Level</em> (ISO 10324), <em>American 
  National Standard for Serial Holdings Statements</em> (ANSI/NISO Z39.44), <em>Library 
  of Congress Classification</em> (LCC), or other conventions used by the organization 
  that creates a record. The content of certain coded data elements (e.g., the 
  Leader, fields 007 and 008) is defined in the MARC formats themselves. 
</p><p>The MARC record structure consists of three main components: the Leader, the 
  Directory, and the Variable Fields. The following information summarizes the 
  components of a MARC record. More detail is provided in <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/">MARC 
  21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</a></em>. 
</p><p> 
</p><dl><dt><b>Leader</b></dt><dd>Contains data elements that provide information 
    for the processing of the record. The data elements contain numbers or coded
    values and are identified by <font color="#ff0000">a</font> relative character 
    position. The Leader is fixed in length at 24 character positions and is the 
    first field in all MARC record<font color="#ff0000">s</font>.</dd><dt><br>
    <b>Directory</b></dt><dd>Contains a series of entries that contain the 
    tag, length, and starting location of each variable field within a record.
    Each entry is 12 character positions in length. Directory entries for variable
    control fields appear first, sequenced by tag in increasing numerical order.
    Entries for variable data fields follow, arranged in ascending order according
    to the first character of the tag. The stored sequence of the variable data
    fields in a record does not necessarily correspond to the order of the corresponding
    Directory entries. Duplicate tags are distinguished only by the location
    of
    the respective fields within the record. The Directory ends with a field
    terminator character (ASCII 1E hex).</dd><dt><br>
    <b>Variable fields</b></dt><dd>The data in a MARC 21 record is organized into <strong>variable fields</strong>, 
    each identified by a three-character numeric tag that is stored in the Directory 
    entry for the field. Each field ends with a field terminator character. The 
    MARC record ends with a record terminator (ASCII 1D hex). There are two types 
    of <strong>variable fields</strong>:</dd><dt><b><br>
  Variable control fields</b></dt><dd>The tagged 00X fields. The variable control fields are structurally different 
    from the variable data fields. These fields contain neither indicator positions 
    nor subfield codes. They may contain either a single data element or a series 
    of fixed-length data elements identified by relative character position.</dd><dt><br>
    <b>Variable data fields</b></dt><dd>The tagged 01X-8XX fields.</dd></dl>
<p>Within <em>variable data fields</em>, the following two kinds of content designation 
  are used: 
</p><dl><dt><b>Indicator positions</b></dt><dd>The first two character positions at the beginning of each variable data 
    field that contain values which interpret or supplement the data found in 
    the field. Indicator values are interpreted independently, that is, meaning 
    is not ascribed to the two indicators taken together. Indicator values may 
    be a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character. A blank (ASCII 20 hex), represented 
    in this document as a pound symbol (#), is used 
    in an undefined indicator position. In a defined indicator position, a blank
    may be assigned a meaning, or may mean <em>no information provided</em>.</dd><dt><br>
    <b>Subfield codes</b></dt><dd>Two characters that precede each data element within a field that requires 
    separate manipulation. A subfield code consists of a delimiter (hex 1F), represented 
    in this document as a dollar sign ($), followed 
    by a data element identifier. Data element identifiers are lowercase alphabetic
    or numeric characters. Subfield codes are defined independently for each
    field;
    however, parallel meanings are preserved where possible. Subfield codes are
    defined for purposes of identification. The order of subfields is generally
    specified by standards for the data content, such as the cataloging rules.</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<h3>MULTISCRIPT RECORDS</h3>
<p>A MARC 21 record may contain <em>data</em> in multiple scripts. One script 
  may be considered the primary script of the <em>data content</em> of the record, 
  even though other scripts are also used for data content. (Note: ASCII is used 
  for the structure elements of the record, with most coded data also specified 
  within the ASCII range of characters.) Graphic models for multiscript data are 
  described in the "Multiscript Records" sections, located at the end of each 
  format. 
</p><h3>FIELD AND SUBFIELD REPEATABILITY</h3>
<p>Theoretically, all fields and subfields may be repeated. The nature of the 
  data, however, often precludes repetition. For example, a record may contain 
  only one 1XX field; a bibliographic field 100 may contain only one subfield 
  $a (Personal name) but may contain more than one subfield $c (Titles and other 
  words associated with a name). Field and subfield repeatability/nonrepeatability 
  is indicated by (R) or (NR) following each field and subfield in each MARC 21 
  format. 
</p><h3>FILL CHARACTER AND RELATED VALUES</h3>
<p>A fill character (ASCII 7C hex), represented in this document as a vertical 
  bar (|), may be used in a record when the format specifies a code to be used 
  but the creator of the record decides not to attempt to supply a code. A fill 
  character may not be used in any character position of the leader or tags, indicators, 
  or subfield codes. The use of the fill character in records contributed to a 
  national database may also be dependent upon the national level requirements 
  specified for each data element. 
</p><p>Code u (Unknown or unspecified), when it is defined, is used to indicate that
  the creator of the record attempted to supply a code but was unable to determine
  what the appropriate code should be. 
</p><p>Code n (Not applicable), when it is defined, is 
  used to indicate that the characteristic defined by the position is not applicable
  to a specific type of item or kind of record. 
</p><h3>DISPLAY CONSTANTS</h3>
<p>A display constant is a term, phrase, and/or spacing or punctuation convention 
  that may be system generated to make a visual presentation of data in a record 
  more meaningful to a user. The display text is not carried in the record but 
  an indication for it, based on tags, indicators, subfield codes, or coded values, 
  is. Suggested display constants and display examples are provided in each MARC 
  21 format. The use and display of these constants is determined by each organization 
  or system. 
</p><h4>Record Content Responsibility</h4>
In general, the responsibility for the data content, content designation, and 
transcription of data within a MARC 21 record may be determined by examination 
of the field indicated in the <strong>responsible parties</strong> section 
below. The data content of certain data elements, however, is restricted 
when the element is an <strong>agency-assigned</strong> or an <strong>authoritative-agency</strong> 
data element. 
<h4>Responsible Parties</h4>
In <em>unmodified</em> records, the organization identified as the original cataloging 
source in 008/39 and/or 040 $c (Transcribing agency) is responsible for the data 
content of the record. The organizations identified as the transcribing agency 
in field 040 is responsible for the content designation and transcription of the 
data.<br>
<br>
In <em>modified</em> records, organizations identified in field 040 $a (Original 
cataloging agency) and $d (Modifying agency) are collectively responsible for 
the data content of the record. Organizations identified as transcribing or modifying 
agencies in field 040 $c and $d are collectively responsible for the content designation 
and transcription of the data. 
<h4>Agency-Assigned Data Elements</h4>
An agency-assigned data element is one whose content is determined by a designated 
agency and is the responsibility of that agency, e.g., field 222 (Key Title) which 
is the responsibility of an ISSN Center. While it is usually input by the designated 
agency, it may be transcribed by another organization. 
<h4>Controlled-List Data Elements</h4>
Certain data elements contain data from controlled lists maintained by designated 
agencies, e.g., the <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/geoareas/">MARC Code List for Geographic 
Areas</a> </em> in field 043 (Geographic Area Code) of the bibliographic format.<br>
<br>
These elements are indicated at the field or subfield level in MARC 21 and only 
values from the designated lists may be used. If a change or addition is desirable 
for a list, the maintenance agency for the list should be consulted. 
<h3>OBSOLETE CONTENT DESIGNATORS</h3>
<p>Obsolete content designators are not included in this document. A Web listing 
  is available under the <em>MARC Field Lists</em> at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">www.loc.gov/marc/.</a> 
  An obsolete content designator is not used in new records. It may appear in 
  records that were created prior to the time that it was made obsolete. 
</p><h3>TYPOGRAPHICAL CONVENTIONS</h3>
<p>Throughout this document, the following typographical conventions are used: 
</p><p> 
</p><dl><dt>0 - The graphic 0 represents the digit zero in tags, fixed-position character 
    position citations, and indicator positions. This character is distinct from 
    an uppercase letter O used in examples or text.<br>
    <br>
  </dt><dt># - The graphic symbol # is used for a blank (hex 20) in coded fields and 
    in other special situations where the existence of the character blank might 
    be ambiguous.<br>
    <br>
  </dt><dt>$ - The graphic symbol $ is used for the delimiter (ASCII 1F hex) portion 
    of a subfield code. Within the text, subfield codes are referred to as <em>subfield 
    $a</em>, for example.<br>
    <br>
  </dt><dt>/ - Specific character positions of fixed-length data elements, such as 
    those in the Leader, Directory, and field 008, are expressed using a slash 
    and the number of the character position, e.g., Leader/06.<br>
    <br>
  </dt><dt><font color="#ff0000">1 - The graphic 1 represents the digit one (hex 31).
      This character must be distinguished from a lowercase roman alphabet letter
      l (el) and the uppercase
    letter I (eye) in examples or text.</font><br>
    <br>
  </dt><dt>| - The graphic | represents a fill character (hex 7C).</dt></dl>
