</p><h3><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>
<dl>This document contains a list of languages and their associated three-character 
  alphabetic codes. The purpose of this list is to allow the designation of the 
  language or languages in MARC records. The list contains 457 discrete codes, 
  of which 55 are used for groups of languages. </dl>
<dl><dt><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></dt><dt> </dt><hr><h3>CHANGES IN 2003 EDITION</h3>This list includes all valid codes and code assignments as of February 2003. 
  There are 24 code additions and 5 changed code captions in this revision. 
  <p> 
  </p><dt><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></dt><dt> </dt><hr><h3>STRUCTURE OF THE CODES</h3>The language codes are three-character lowercase alphabetic strings usually 
  based on the first three letters of the English form or, in some cases, vernacular 
  of the corresponding language name. The codes are varied where necessary to 
  resolve conflicts. In the case of modern and older forms of some languages, 
  the initial letters of each part of the language name are used to form the code, 
  e.g. <em>gmh</em>for German, Middle High, and <em>goh</em>for German, Old 
  High. When the name of a language is changed in the list, the original code 
  is generally retained. 
  <p> 
  </p><dt><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></dt><dt> </dt><hr><h3>INDIVIDUAL LANGUAGE CODES</h3>This list includes individual codes for most of the major languages of the modern 
  and ancient world, e.g. Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Latin, Tagalog, etc. 
  These are the languages that are most frequently represented in the total body 
  of the world's literature. Additional codes for individual languages are created 
  from time to time when it becomes apparent that a significant body of literature 
  in a particular language already exists, or when it is determined that the amount 
  of material in a language is growing.<br><br>Usually only one code is provided for a given language, even if that language 
  can be written in more than one set of characters. In a few cases however, separate 
  codes are provided for the same spoken language written in different characters. 
  <p> <a href="#top">Go to top of document</a> 
  </p><dt> </dt><hr><h3>LANGUAGE GROUP CODES</h3>In addition to codes for individual languages, the list also contains a number 
  of codes for language groups. While some individual languages are given their 
  own unique code, although linguistically they are part of a language group, 
  many individual languages are assigned a group code, because it is not considered 
  practical to establish a separate code for each.<br><br>Group codes may be recognized by the fact that the name listed in association 
  with the code does not represent an individual language, and includes either 
  the generic term "languages" or the expression "(Other)," as opposed to names 
  of individual languages which do not include these terms. For example: 
  <p> 
  </p><dl compact="compact"><dt><b>myn</b></dt><dd>Mayan languages</dd></dl><dl compact="compact"><dt><b>nic</b></dt><dd>Niger-Kordofanian (Other)</dd></dl><p> These language group codes are generally established at a very broad level, 
    e.g. South American Indian (Other) <em>sai</em>. Although some South American 
    Indian languages have their own unique codes, such as Mapuche <em>arn</em> 
    and Aymara <em>aym</em>, all other South American Indian languages which have 
    not been assigned a unique code, such as the Cumana language, are assigned 
    the group code <em>sai</em>. 
  </p><p>Some group codes have been established at an intermediate level when individual 
    languages and dialects within that group did not warrant discrete codes, yet 
    it was felt that assignment to one of the very broad group codes was not sufficiently 
    specific. For example, the Athapascan language group, a subgroup of North 
    American Indian languages, is given the code <em>ath</em>, and that code rather 
    than <em>nai</em>, the code for North American Indian (Other), is assigned 
    to Athapascan languages not having their own codes. 
  </p><p> Ancient languages which are not given unique codes are assigned the code 
    for the major language group to which each belongs, rather than the code for 
    the modern language which evolved from the ancient language. Thus, the language 
    Swedish, Old is assigned the code <em>gem</em> for the language group Germanic 
    (Other) instead of the code <em>swe</em> for the modern language Swedish. 
  </p><p> Dialects are normally treated like any individual language entered in the 
    list, and are generally assigned a group code. However, if a dialect of a 
    language as well as the language itself is entered in the list, the dialect 
    is usually assigned the same code as the code for the language. If the language 
    is assigned a group code, the dialect is assigned the same group code. For 
    example, Bolinao, a dialect of Sambali, and Sambali language itself are both 
    assigned <em>phi</em>, the group code for Philippine (Other). If the language 
    has a unique code, the dialect is also assigned that code rather than the 
    code for the group to which both belong. For example, Aja, a dialect of Ewe, 
    is assigned <em>ewe</em>, the code for Ewe. In a few instances, however, both 
    the language and a dialect of that language have their own unique codes. For 
    example, Akan has the code <em>aka</em>, and Twi, a dialect of Akan, has the 
    code <em>twi</em>.

  </p><dt> </dt><hr><h3>NAMES OF LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS</h3>The form of name of a language used in this code list normally corresponds to 
  the form of the name appearing in <em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em>(LCSH), with the exception that names of individual languages in the list generally 
  do not include the terms "language" or "dialect" and consist of only the substantive 
  portion of the name. For example: </dl>
<ul>
  English <i>(name in code list)</i> <br>
  English language <i>(name in LCSH)</i> 
</ul>
<dl>LCSH forms of names have not been used for the code list name if they make 
  use of subdivisions; instead such headings are reformulated into phrase expressions 
  for this list. This most often occurs in connection with headings for local 
  dialects: </dl>
<ul>
  Morvan French <i>(name in code list)</i> <br>
  French Language--Dialects--France--Morvan <i>(name in LCSH)</i> 
</ul>
<dl>In addition, names of early forms of modern languages often appear in the 
  code list in a form different from LCSH which frequently makes use of chronological 
  subdivisions: 
  <p> 
  </p><ul>
    Swedish, Old (to 1550) <i>(name in code list)</i> <br>
    Swedish language--To 1550 <i>(name in LCSH)</i> 
  </ul><p>  
  </p><dt><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a> </dt><p> 
  </p><hr><h3>SPECIAL CODES FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS</h3>In addition to codes for individual languages and language groups, codes are 
  also provided for three special situations. 
  <p> 
  </p><dt><b>Undetermined [und]</b></dt><dd>This code is used if the language associated with an item cannot be determined. 
    This code is also used for works having textual content consisting of arbitrary 
    syllables, humming or other human-produced sounds for which a language cannot 
    be specified.</dd><p> 
  </p><dt><b>Multiple languages [mul]</b></dt><dd>This code is used when two or more languages are associated with an item, 
    and it is not practical to use codes for all of the languages.</dd><p> 
  </p><dt><b>Blanks [###]</b></dt><dd>Three blanks are used in place of a language code when the item has no sung, 
    spoken, or written textual content (e.g. instrumental or electronic music; 
    sound recordings consisting of nonverbal sounds; audiovisual materials with 
    no narration, printed titles, or subtitles; machine-readable data files consisting 
    of machine languages or character codes).</dd><dt> </dt><dt> </dt><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a><p> 
  </p><hr><h3>ARRANGEMENT OF THE LIST</h3>The list is made up of two basic parts: Part I: Name Sequence, and Part II: 
  Code Sequence. A description of these two parts follows. 
  <h4>Part I: Name Sequence</h4>In this part, the languages are listed alphabetically by the name. An entry 
  for an individual language gives the name followed by the code in brackets, 
  both in boldface. Any variant names of the language are listed on successive 
  lines, with the first variant preceded by the symbol UF (used for). For example: 
</dl>
<dl><dt> <b>Aramaic [arc]</b> </dt><dd> 
    <dl compact="compact"><dt> <small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Biblical Aramaic</dd><dd>Chaldean</dd></dl>
  </dd></dl>
The entry for an individual language which does not have a unique code, but is 
assigned a group code is similar, except that the assigned code with its language 
group name is given on the lines following the name. For example: 
<p> 
</p><dl><dt> <b>Chabacano</b> </dt><dd> 
    <dl compact="compact"><dt><i>Assigned collective code</i> <b>[crp]</b> </dt><dd>(Creoles and Pidgins (Other))</dd></dl>
    <dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Chavacano</dd><dd>Zamboangueño</dd></dl>
  </dd></dl>
<p>The entry for a language group is also similar to that for an individual language, 
  with the addition of a list of the individual languages which have been assigned 
  that group code. This list follows the variant names, if any are given. For 
  example: </p>
<p> 
</p><dl><dt><b>Creoles and Pidgins (Other) [crp]</b> </dt><dd> 
    <dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Pidgins</dd></dl>
    <dl compact="compact"><dt> <i>Collective code for:</i> </dt><dd> <i>Chabacano</i></dd><dd> <i>Fanakalo</i></dd><dd> <i>Naga Pidgin</i></dd><dd> <i>San Basilio del Palenque Spanish Creole</i></dd><dd> <i>Unami jargon</i></dd></dl>
  </dd></dl>
<p>The variant names from each of these entries also appear in their alphabetic 
  position in the list as references, but not in boldface. For example: </p>
<dl><dt>Bafang </dt><dd> 
    <dl compact="compact"><dt> <small>USE</small> </dt><dd>Fe'fe'</dd></dl>
  </dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Chaldean </dt><dd> 
    <dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>Aramaic</dd></dl>
  </dd></dl>
These references do not give the code; the entry under the name referred to must 
be consulted to determine the code. 
<h4>Part II: Code Sequence</h4>
In this part, the languages and their codes are listed alphabetically by the code. 
Only the name of the individual language or language group and the associated 
code are given in this part. Tracings or references for variant forms of the language 
names are not included. For example: 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><b>arc</b></dt><dd>Aramaic</dd><dt><b>bai</b></dt><dd>Bamileke languages</dd></dl>
<p>Languages which are assigned a group code are not included in the code sequence 
  part. Thus, the language Fe'fe' which is assigned the group code <em>bai</em> 
  does not appear in this part of the list.</p>
<p>Discontinued codes are also listed in this part in their alphabetical sequence. 
  They are identified by a hyphen preceding the code. For example: </p>
<dt> <strong>-ajm</strong></dt>
<dd>Aljamía</dd>

</p><hr>
<h3>USE OF LANGUAGE NAMES IN CATALOGING</h3>
The names of individual languages which appear in boldface are the form normally 
used in uniform titles and notes in bibliographic records. For example: 
<ul>
  Homer. Iliad. English. <i>(form in uniform title)</i> <br>
  Text in Coptic and French; notes in French. <i>(form in note)</i> 
</ul>
<p> <em>Library of Congress Rule Interpretations</em> 1.7B2 and 25.5C may be consulted 
  for specific instructions and exceptions. 
</p><p>The individual languages which appear in boldface also usually correspond to 
  the subject headings for those languages in LCSH. The relationship of language 
  names in this list to LCSH is described more fully above in the section "Names 
  of Languages and Dialects."

<h3>PUBLICATION BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>This list was originally compiled in collaboration with Library of Congress 
  MARC Pilot Project participants, the National Library of Medicine, the National 
  Agricultural Library, and the Defense Language Institute. In addition, the language 
  list of the Center for Applied Linguistics, <em>Library of Congress Subject 
  Headings</em> (LCSH), and language specialists were consulted. The list was 
  revised by a committee of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) 
  and became an American National Standard in 1987: <em>Codes for the Representation 
  of Languages for Information Interchange</em> (ANSI Z39.53). In 2000, the list 
  was further revised to include numerous changes necessary for compatibility 
  with the ISO 639-2 <em>(Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 
  2: Alpha-3 Code</em>) standard. </p>

<h3>CODE MAINTENANCE</h3>
<p>The Library of Congress is the maintenance agency for this list and for both 
  ANSI Z39.53 and ISO 639-2. Questions and requests for information about this 
  list should be sent to the Cataloging Policy and Support Office, Library of 
  Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540-4305 (e-mail: <a href="mailto:cpso@loc.gov">cpso@loc.gov</a>). 
  ANSI Z39.53 and ISO 639-2 include only the list of codes and associated language 
  or language group name (as in Part II of this document).</p>
<p>Requests for new language codes are submitted to the ISO 639-2 maintenance 
  agency, Library of Congress, (<a href="mailto:iso639-2@loc.gov">iso639-2@loc.gov</a>) 
  and balloted by the ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee. Once approved, they are 
  added to the ISO 639-2 and MARC lists and are included in ANSI Z39.53 when revised. 
  Notices describing additions/deletions of code values will be issued for all 
  changes to the language codes made in the interim period between issuance of 
  revised versions of this document. Please consult the MARC website (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">www.loc.gov/marc/</a>)
