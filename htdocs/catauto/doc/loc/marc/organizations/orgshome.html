<h3><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>
<p>The <i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> contains
short alphabetic codes used to represent names of libraries and
other kinds of organizations that need to be identified in the
bibliographic environment.  This code list is an essential
reference tool for those dealing with MARC records, for systems
reporting library holdings, for many interlibrary loan systems, and
for those who may be organizing cooperative projects on a regional,
national, or international scale.  There are a number of data
elements in the MARC formats that call for institutional
identifiers, the chief ones being those that identify the
organization assigning the record control number, the agency
responsible for creating or modifying a record, and the agency
holding a copy of the item.  In particular, it is a key to codes
for holding institutions represented in the Library of Congress 
<i>National Union Catalog</i> (NUC) and other union
list publications which contain holdings for reporting
institutions.</p>
<p>This code list for organizations is the latest update to the
list, previously published under the title 
<i>USMARC Code List for Organizations</i> (1996
edition).  It includes 5,492 new codes assigned since the last
edition.  A small number of existing codes have been changed or
made obsolete.  In all cases, previously valid codes are given as
references.  The large number of new codes can be attributed to
continuing expansion of the use of standard identifiers, nationally
by school libraries (particularly for statewide projects) and
internationally as information is shared globally via the
Internet.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></p>
<h3>SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT</h3>
<p>This new edition contains 31,723 codes, of which 27,719 are
valid identifiers for general use.  The list includes 4,004
references from invalid codes, 2,294 of which are references from
codes taken from other published lists which are mentioned in the
"Historical Developments" section below.</p>
<p>The codes listed in this publication are used to designate
United States and, to a lesser extent, non-U.S. libraries and other
institutions.  While organizations are free to employ these codes
for their own purposes, the primary use of them by the libraries
and other organizations is still for bibliographic applications. 
The list is augmented through applications for new codes, not as
the result of unsolicited assignment.</p>

<h3><a name="history">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS</a></h3>
<p>The <i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> grew out of the need for standard 
  institutional codes to serve various bibliographic projects in the early 20th 
  century. The first of these came into existence in the early part of the last 
  century, when Charles Evans wanted to report that a certain library held one 
  of the titles listed in his <i>American Bibliography</i> (published 1903-1959). 
  He assumed that the abbreviation "BPL" would be identified immediately as representing 
  the Boston Public Library, or that "HC" could only mean Harvard College to the 
  reader. Prior to Evans developing his list of library codes, Joseph Sabin had 
  used codes of his own to identify libraries in his <i>Dictionary of Books Relating 
  to America</i> (published 1867-1936). He had used "B" and "H" to represent Boston 
  Public Library and Harvard College, respectively. Others used codes such as 
  "BoP" and "Har", or "B.P." and "CH". As bibliographies appeared one after another, 
  it became incumbent upon each editor to include an explanation of the codes 
  used to identify libraries and other institutions. Over the years, when one 
  library wished to refer to other libraries, it adopted abbreviations used by 
  respected reference works or it invented new abbreviations of its own.</p>
<p>In 1916, the discovery that the Universities of Illinois,
Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin were all about to publish lists
of their serial holdings, independently of one another, gave rise
to a cooperative movement on a national scale which eventually
produced the first <i>Union List of Serials</i> (ULS) (which was first
published in 1927).  The scope of this project necessitated the
creation of many new identifiers for libraries.  Since reporting
institutions were to be found in every state, Frank Peterson, of
the University of Nebraska, worked out a mnemonic system of codes
that identified a library's location by the
use of geographic prefixes.  His geographic prefixes predated the
familiar U.S. state and Canadian provincial abbreviations used by
postal services and in many other applications.
</p>
<p>Peterson's scheme was of special interest to the Library of
Congress, which had greatly expanded its 
<i>Union Catalog</i> by "Project B", an effort
financed by a Rockefeller Foundation grant in 1926.  By April 1932,
at the conclusion of the Rockefeller project, a modest pamphlet
entitled 
<i>Key to Symbols in Union Catalogs</i> was
published by the Library of Congress.  That publication identified
the 367 libraries represented in the 
<i>Union Catalog</i> at that time and is considered
the first edition of what would eventually become this MARC list. 
A slightly enlarged second edition appeared in January 1933.  A
more substantial 
<i>Key to Symbols used in the Union Catalog</i>,
containing 685
entries, was issued in August 1936 as the third edition of the
list.</p>
<p>As additional libraries began to send reports to the 
<i>Union Catalog</i> the Library of Congress
assigned them unique identifiers composed of letters of the
alphabet, usually including a geographic prefix.  Eventually some
of the codes assigned for the 
<i>Union List of Serials</i> began to conflict with
those needed for new contributions to the 
<i>Union Catalog</i>.  For many years there were
attempts to harmonize LC codes with those of the 
<i>Union List of Serials</i>, or, conversely, to
harmonize the ULS forms with those of LC.  The situation was
exacerbated in 1937 with the appearance of Winifred Gregory's 
<i>American Newspapers,</i> 1821-1936, which
assigned codes from Peterson's scheme without securing concurrence
with the 
<i>Union Catalog</i>.</p>
<p>These problems were given a new dimension in October 1939 when
Douglas McMurtrie published 
<i>Location Symbols for Libraries in the United
States</i>.  His list was prepared "for the use of ... the staff
of the American Imprints Inventory of the Historical Records Survey
Program".  It contained 12,000 identifiers representing every
public, college, and university library in the United States. 
Unfortunately, most of these libraries did not report to the 
<i>Union Catalog</i>.  Years later a regional
cooperative project, all in good faith, adopted the McMurtrie codes
for its own use without consulting the 
<i>National Union Catalog</i>, only to learn that LC
had shortened the seven-letter McMurtrie codes to three letters in
the interim.
</p>
<p>In 1941, McMurtrie published the 
<i>Proposed List of Location Symbols for Libraries in
All Countries of the World Except the United States</i>.  In
this list he divided the world by continents, countries, and cities
(e.g., Eu-Fr-P for Paris, France; An-C-T for Toronto, Canada in
"America, North").  Although this proposal did not survive the
massive revision of boundaries and geographic names resulting from
the Second World War, some of its Canadian codes were put into use
before the creation of the national Canadian scheme.  Some of these
codes are still found in Canadian reference sources.</p>
<p><i>Symbols Used in the Union Catalog of the Library of
Congress</i> appeared in 1942 as the fourth edition of the 
<i>Key to Symbols</i>.  The title changed slightly
with the fifth edition, published in 1953.  Its title, 
<i>Symbols Used in the National Union Catalog of the
Library of Congress</i>, was kept through the ninth edition,
published in 1965.  The publication of the sixth edition in 1954
coincided with the inauguration of 
<i>New Serial Titles</i> and the conversion of
Canadian codes from the McMurtrie format to a new system sponsored
and maintained by the National Library of Canada.  To keep the size
of the list within reasonable bounds, organizations were dropped in
later editions if they had not reported to the 
<i>Union Catalog</i> since the previous edition. 
One of the principal values of the list was negated by this
editorial decision.  The assignment of duplicate codes became
almost inevitable unless each of the previous editions was
consulted.  Fortunately, most of the organizations that were
dropped did not begin reporting again later.  Some of the more
complicated problems encountered in assigning codes arose because
the absence of cumulative records of the codes that had been
assigned.
</p>
<p>As the Library of Congress continued to issue new editions of
its code list it gradually became apparent that the 
<i>National Union Catalog</i> was the one nationwide
project that outlived the publication of individual bibliographies
or specific bibliographic projects.  In the absence of any other
organized effort on such a large scale, it fell upon the Library of
Congress to assign new codes to organizations even if they were to
be involved only in regional projects of some kind.  For this
reason, beginning with the tenth edition published in 1969, the
list of institutional identifiers came to be known by the title, 
<i>Symbols of American Libraries</i>, a title it
carried for another quarter of a century.  Beginning in the early
1970's, it became common for cooperating institutions to secure a
unique identifier before participating in any bibliographic project
that required one.  The responsibility for assigning codes to
organizations was held by various divisions within the Library of
Congress, including the Catalog Publication Division, its
successors, the Catalog Management and Publications Division, and
Enhanced Cataloging Division.  In 1994 the Network Development and
MARC Standards Office (NDMSO) assumed the task of assigning new
codes, maintaining the list, and making it available.  Since in
recent years the codes in the list are used most heavily in MARC
records, it is here that the work of Frank Peterson, Douglas
McMurtrie, the compilers of the 
<i>Union List of Serials</i>, and many others found
a new home.</p>
<p>The 1996 edition of the list (the 15th since its inception) was
published under the title 
<i>USMARC Code List for Organizations</i>.  The
title of this 2000 Edition of the list was changed to 
<i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> in
recognition of the harmonization of USMARC and CanMARC to form the
new 
<i>MARC 21</i> format family, and the expanded use
of these codes in other MARC formats.
</p><p><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></p>
<h3>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</h3>
<p>With the development in the late 1960's of the MARC formats for
machine-readable data, uses other than identifying holding
institutions emerged for organization codes.  In the
machine-readable records, organization codes identify cataloging
agencies, record creators, inputting institutions, updating
institutions, agencies assigning the record control number, and
other institution-specific data, in addition to holdings.  In the
last decade, the use of institutional identifiers from the 
<i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> has
increased internationally, with many foreign requests for codes for
national libraries and major university libraries that participate
in American-based projects.  The list now includes almost 5,000
codes for non-U.S. organizations, approximately 17% of the total. 
The advent of cooperative cataloging projects, which allow
institutions to share machine-readable bibliographic information,
has put even more emphasis on the importance of a single system of
organization codes.  In addition interlibrary loan systems use
organization codes extensively.  An International Standard for
organization codes (ISO 15511--International standard identifier
for libraries and related organizations) embraces many of the
features of the codes in this MARC list.  When published, ISO 15511
will accommodate the codes from this list, although some revisions
to the assignment policy for non-U.S. organizations will be needed
in the MARC list.
</p><p><a href="#top">Go to top of document</a></p>
<h3><a name="struct">STRUCTURE OF THE CODES</a></h3>
<p>The MARC organization codes are structured and employ mnemonics
to assist in visual location and identification of the institutions
represented.  The ULS system of mnemonic codes based on
geographical location was adopted by the Library of Congress for
many institution codes, particularly libraries.  While city, state,
national, and university libraries do not tend to change location,
commercial firms do move occasionally from city to city and state
to state.  Therefore, identifiers created for them in the early
years of the list are usually based on the name of the organization
alone rather than a combination of a geographical and name
elements.  In recent years, a more consistent assignment policy has
been implemented which allows for all new codes to begin with a
geographic prefix.</p>
<h4><u>General Structure</u></h4>
<p>The following general principles are used for code assignment.
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Character set</b> - Codes are composed of basic
Latin alphabetic characters and the dash ( - ).  Parentheses occur
in some obsolete codes but are avoided in newly assigned codes. 
Dashes are counted in determining the maximum length of a code, but
are ignored in sorting and in determining uniqueness.</li>
<li><b>Case</b> - Codes generally consist of a
combination of upper and lowercase alphabetic characters, although
they may consist of all upper or all lowercase letters.  The use of
upper and lowercase letters helps to improve the readability of the
codes.  Case is ignored in sorting and in determining
uniqueness.</li>
<li>
<b>Length</b> - Codes are variable in length but
should not exceed eight characters.  The dash ( - ) that is used in
some codes is included in the character count.  Beginning in 1989,
codes found to contain more than eight characters were either
shortened or made obsolete in favor of a newly-assigned (shorter)
code conform to a new policy agreed upon by various MARC
users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h4><u>Structure of Subunits</u></h4>
<p>Each code consists of from one to four subunits.  The first
subunit usually represents a higher-level geographical
jurisdiction.  Subsequent subunits generally represent the
next-lower jurisdictions and/or the name of the organization
itself.  The initial character of each subunit is an uppercase
letter, although the institutional subunit, the final one, may
consist of multiple uppercase letters.
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>First Subunit</b> - For institutions in the
United States, the first subunit is usually for a state or
territory.  For non-U.S. organizations, the first subunit indicates
the country. This geographic unit is usually one or two alphabetic
characters.  U.S. states that were most active bibliographically at
the time the system was developed were given a single-letter
designation (for example: codes for organizations in New York state
use the geographic prefix "N" as the initial unit of the MARC
code).  Other jurisdictions and those whose names begin with the
same letter are identified by addition of a lowercase letter to the
initial uppercase letter (for example: "Nc" for North Carolina,
"Ag" for Argentina).  When the first subunit represents a country,
an effort has been made to prefer a prefix that corresponds to
codes in the 
<i>MARC Code List for Countries</i>.  For some
long-established prefixes (for example: "Ca" for Canada and "Uk"
for England), the country-level geographic prefix is different in
this list.</li>
<li><b>Second Subunit</b> - In most cases, the subunit
for a highest-level jurisdiction is followed by a second subunit
representing a geographic entity, such as a city or town.  This
subunit begins with an uppercase letter and is composed of one or
more alphabetic characters.  Subunits for cities and towns are
usually one or two characters (for example: "TxDa" for Dallas,
Texas), although others are longer (for example: "NNopo" for
Northport, New York, and "MStoc" for Stockbridge, Massachusetts).
The current policy is to prefer two-character prefixes for cities. 
This has resulted in the "retirement" of some three and
four-character geographic prefixes for certain cities, and the
expansion of some one-character city prefixes to two
characters.</li>
<li><b>Third Subunit</b> - The third subunit usually
represents the name of the institution.  This unit also begins with
an uppercase letter and is composed of one or more upper or
lowercase letters.  The letters are taken from words in the
organization's name, usually initial letters but conflicts with
existing codes may require some other choice.  Examples include:
"MSaE" for Essex Institute in Salem, Mass., "MSaP" for the Peabody
Museum in the same city, "PPiUSM" for the U.S. Bureau of Mines in
Pittsburgh, Pa., "PPiUS" for the U.S. Steel corporation, also in
Pittsburgh, and "FrPURD" for the Université René
Descartes in Paris, France.</li>
<li><b>Fourth Subunit (Dashes)</b> - A fourth subunit is sometimes added to a 
  code to identify a subdivision of a larger organization. If the base code is 
  not already seven (7) characters long, it may be separated from the preceding 
  subunits by a dash ( - ), for example, "ICU-L" for the Law Library of the University 
  of Chicago; "DN-Ob" for the Naval Observatory, a division of the U.S. Department 
  of the Navy in Washington, D.C. The fourth subunit also begins with an uppercase 
  letter and is composed of one or more upper or lowercase letters. The letters 
  are taken from words in the name of the subdivision. The dash is counted as 
  one of the characters toward the maximum of eight characters. The code string, 
  without the dash, is also unique against the other valid codes in the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p><h4><u>Exceptions to Standard Structure</u></h4>
<p>The judgment and work of many persons has gone into the creation
and maintenance of the institutional identifiers over a number of
years. The following special conventions were used in the early
assignment of codes, for simplicity.  While no longer applied in
newly-assigned codes, familiarity with these older practices helps
to understand why a particular combination of letters was assigned
to an organization.
</p><ul>
<li>-Official U.S. state libraries are often identified by the
state code alone, e.g., "Mo".</li>
<li>-U.S. state universities are identified by an uppercase
letter "U" following the code for the state, e.g., "TxU",
"InU".</li>
<li>-U.S. city, state, and Canadian provincial historical
societies are represented by the unit "Hi" added to the appropriate
geographic unit, e.g., WHi", "MnHi".</li>
<li>-A small number of libraries which participated in the
earliest bibliographic projects have retained codes that were
assigned to them before the standard structure was established,
e.g., "MH" for Harvard and "CtY" for Yale (city subunits omitted
for both).</li>
<li>-Older codes assigned to the public libraries of U.S. and
Canadian cities and towns often consist of the subunit for the U.S.
state (or Canadian province) and city alone.  Codes assigned after
1992 do not follow this practice and routinely include a subunit
representing the name of the organization, even if the name is
simply "public library" (represented as "PL").</li>
<li>-For commercial enterprises, older codes consist of a code
based on the firm's name alone, e.g., "BMI" for Bay Microfilms,
Inc., "UnM" for University Microfilms, and "EpG" for the EP Group
of Companies.  These identifiers are considered a single subunit,
that for the institution, which for most other codes is the third
unit.  Although some of these older codes lacking geographic
prefixes are harder to decipher, they have been retained without
change as much as possible.</li>
<li>-In most cases, the code for an organization is changed
when its location or name is changed.  In a few instances,
organizations prefer to retain an older code, to minimize confusion
(for example: some state universities retain letters reminiscent of
earlier names or status such as "T" for "Teacher" or "C" for
"College").</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h4><u>Use Guidelines</u></h4>
<p>The organization codes in this list are designed to be used
wherever the recording of the full name of an organization is not
possible or desirable.  There is no restriction on their use
outside the MARC or bibliographic environment.  Because the codes
are unique regardless of capitalization and hyphenation, they can
be recorded as all lower case letters or all upper case letters,
with or without hyphens.  The MARC 21 formats prescribe the use of
codes from this list in a number of data elements (for example,
field 040 (Cataloging Source)).  It is recommended that the
capitalization and hyphenation shown in this list be followed, as
much as possible, to facilitate the legibility and intelligibility
of these codes.</p>
<p>Although use of obsolete codes is permitted in the MARC records, their use in
newly-created records is discouraged, as obsolete codes are often non-unique or
in some way less desirable than the valid codes for organizations.  References from obsolete
codes to the valid MARC organization codes are included in this list.</p>

<h3>CODES FOR ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.</h3>
<p>Codes for organizations outside the U.S. are generally
structured like U.S. codes except that the first subunit is for the
country.  As stated previously, the first subunit of the code is
usually based on the code from the <i>MARC Code List for
Countries</i> (for example: "Fr" for France).  The second subunit represents the local
jurisdiction, usually city or town.  The final unit represents the
actual name of the organization and may be absent in some cases, as
has been described already.  For Canada, the subunit for the
country is followed by a subunit representing the province, and a
third subunit which represents the city or town.  The fourth
subunit represents the name of the organization.  The National
Library of Canada (NCL) assigns codes for Canadian organizations. 
The current practice for the MARC list is to add the prefix "Ca" to
the codes assigned by NLC.</p>
<p>In 1973, the National Library of Canada revised all Canadian
codes which contained lowercase letters so that only uppercase
letters were used.  In the U.S., combinations of upper and
lowercase letters continue to be used, although for newly-assigned
Canadian codes, generally only the second letter of the code (e.g.,
"CaOONL") is lowercase.</p>

<h3>NAMES AND ADDRESSES</h3>
<p>Names and addresses of organizations listed in this publication are intended 
  to be complete enough for mailing purposes. Since most local, state, college, 
  and university libraries can be located without a street address, often only 
  the city, state, postal code are given for these entities. An effort has been 
  made to include street addresses if they were available at the time this publication 
  was sent to press. For foreign organizations, the name of the country is given 
  in all cases.</p>

<h3><a name="searches">SEARCHING ONLINE BY CODE OR NAME</a></h3>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cgi-bin/zgstart?ACTION=INIT&amp;FORM_HOST_PORT=/prod/www/data/z3950/loctr05.html,rs20.loc.gov,8210">CLICK HERE</a> to go immediately
to the search interface for the MARC Organization Code database,
or read about the content of the online database first.  The web site
provides access to the <i>MARC Code
List for Organizations</i> by code and organization name.</p>
<h4><u>Code Searches</u></h4>
<p>Searches by MARC organization code can be done using both valid
and invalid codes.  Since a normalized version of the valid MARC
code without hyphens or capitalization is provided, it is not necessary
to key in the correct combination of upper and lowercase letters
when searching.  Valid and invalid codes are clearly marked in the
MARC organization code database.</p>
<h4><u>Name Searches</u></h4>
<p>It is also possible to search the MARC organization code list by
name of organization.  Both keyword and phrase searches are supported.
It is not necessary to use uppercase letters or diacritical marks in
searching.  Multiple name entries are provided for organizations
with variant names, or foreign organizations whose names appear in
other languages.  In all cases, names are represented using the
Latin alphabet only.  The 2000 Edition of the 
<i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> has added
name entries using Pinyin romanization for Chinese organizations. 
This enhancement coincides with the adoption, by American
libraries, of Pinyin as the preferred romanization scheme for
Chinese.  The transliteration of names in other non-roman scripts
generally follows the guidelines in the widely used 
<i>ALA-LC Romanization Tables</i>.</p>

<p>Once you have applied for a new code, it takes one to two
weeks for processing.  The <i>MARC Code List for Organizations</i> is very
dynamic.  Between 50 and 100 new codes are added weekly.  Since information
in the requests must be verified and massaged into the MARC Organization
Codes database, a short delay between time of request and appearance of a
newly-assigned code in the database should be expected.  Names and
addresses are revised when changes are reported to us.  You can use the online request
form to request a code for one organization.  If you need codes for more than one
organization, you can fill out the Web form for each organization, <i>but</i> it is best
to send a request via email including a list of the organization names, their addresses
(including street, city, state, postal code, and country), and
contact information to the following email address: 
<b>NDMSO@LOC.GOV</b></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> For security reasons, attachments to email messages
(such as <i>MS Word</i> files) are not accepted.</p>
<p>Requests for the assignment of new codes or changes involving
organizations in Canada are processed in cooperation with the
National Library of Canada (in Ottawa, Ontario), which is
ultimately responsible for the codes for organizations within that
country.</p>
<p>Requests for the assignment of new MARC organization codes or
for changes to existing names, and/or addresses, can also be
