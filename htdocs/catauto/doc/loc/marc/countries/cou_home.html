<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document contains a list of places and their associated two- or 
   three-character lowercase alphabetic codes.  The list includes individual 
   codes for presently existing  national entities, states of the United 
   States, provinces and territories of Canada, divisions of the United 
   Kingdom, and internationally recognized dependencies. The purpose of 
   this list is to allow the designation of the place associated with an 
   item by codes in the MARC record for that item.  The list contains 
   362 discrete codes, of which 45 are discontinued codes no longer valid 
   for use.</p>
   
<p>The list was originally compiled in 1967/68 in collaboration with a 
   number of agencies and the Library of Congress MARC Pilot Project 
   participants.</p>

<p>The list published here includes all valid and obsolete codes as of May 2003.
   This revised edition includes 1 newly assigned code. Appendix A lists all 
   changes since the 2000 edition.</p>

<h3><a name="co00stru">STRUCTURE AND ASSIGNMENT OF CODES</a></h3>
<p>The country codes are two- or three-character lowercase alphabetic strings. 
   National entities are generally assigned a two-character code (exceptions are 
   noted below). When possible, the first letter of the code is the same as the 
   first letter of the place name in most cases. When there were insufficient 
   available codes beginning with the first letter of the place name 
   to accommodate all of the place names that begin with that letter 
   of the alphabet, a code with <em>x</em> as the first letter was 
   assigned, e.g. Marshall Islands (<em>xe</em>).</p>
  
<p>Three-character codes are assigned to states of the United States, provinces 
   and territories of Canada and divisions of the United Kingdom. In this case, 
   the first two characters represent the constituent part, and the third character 
   represents the country, e.g. <em>nyu</em> for New York. Three-character codes 
   are also used for the United States (<em>xxu</em>), Canada (<em>xxc</em>), and the 
   United Kingdom (<em>xxk</em>) when the state, province or territory, or division 
   is not known, but the country is known, or when it is not desired to code at 
   the lower level. In this case, the first two characters (<em>xx</em>) represent 
   "unknown or undetermined," and the third character represents the country.</p>
   
<p>Codes are assigned according to present geographic boundaries. A place which 
   has historically been located in more than one political jurisdiction is coded 
   for the jurisdiction in which it is presently located.</p>
   
<p>When a place is given in the bibliographic record with a question mark, a corresponding 
   country code is assigned without regard to the uncertainty. If the place is 
   completely unknown, or undetermined, the code <em>xx</em> is used (see section 
   "Special Codes for Special Situations" below).</p>

<p></p>

<h4><a name="co00spec"><u>Special Codes for Special Situations</u></a></h4>
<p>In addition to codes for individual places, codes are also provided for two 
   special situations.</p>
  
<p><strong>No place, unknown, or undetermined [xx]</strong>. This code is 
   used if the place associated with the item is completely unknown, or 
   undetermined.</p>
   
<p><strong>Various places [vp]</strong>. This code is used if various places 
   are associated with different pieces making up the item.</p>

<h4><a name="co00disc"><u>Discontinued Practice</u></a></h4>
<p>Prior to 1971, when the place associated with the item was in question, this 
   condition was indicated by the addition of the letter <em>q</em> in the third 
   character position of the code or by the use of the next higher letter if the 
   third character position was already used. This practice was discontinued in 
   June 1971. For example, with imprint [Paris?], before 1971 code <em>frq</em> 
   was used instead of <em>fr</em>; and with imprint [Chicago?], code 
   <em>ilv</em> was used instead of <em>ilu</em>. When using the country 
   codes to retrieve records, this practice should be specially noted as 
   not all records encoded before 1971 may have been changed.</p>

<h3><a name="co00arra">ARRANGEMENT OF THE LIST</a></h3>
<p>The country code list is made up of three parts: Part I: Name Sequence, 
   Part II: Code Sequence, and Part III: Regional Sequence. A description 
   of these parts follows.</p>
   
<h3><u>Part I: Name Sequence</u></h3>
<p>In this part, the places are listed alphabetically by the name. An 
   entry for a place represented by a code gives the name followed by 
   the code in brackets, both in boldface. Any variant names of the 
   place or names of places assigned to use that code are listed 
   on successive lines, with the first such name preceded by the symbol 
   UF (used for). For example:</p>
   
<dl><dt><strong>American Samoa [as]</strong></dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small></dt><dd>Eastern Samoa</dd><dt></dt><dd>Samoa, American</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>These UF names may represent alternate names of the place, older 
   names of the place, names representing component or subjurisdictional 
   parts of the place, or names of places formerly assigned a 
   separate code. The UF names from each entry also appear in their 
   alphabetic position in the list as references, but not in boldface. 
   These references do not give the code; the entry under the name referred 
   to must be consulted to determine the code. For example:</p>
   
<dl><dt>Eastern Samoa </dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>American Samoa</dd></dl>
</dd><dt>Samoa, American </dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>American Samoa</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>Entries may also include a note in italics explaining a change in 
   the use of codes. For example:</p> 

<dl><dt><strong>Mayotte [ot]</strong> </dt><dd><em>[Coded [cq] (Comoros) before July 1987]</em></dd><dt>Manra Atoll </dt><dd><em>[Coded [gn] (Gilbert and Ellice Islands) before Oct. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>Kiribati</dd></dl>
</dd><dt>Portuguese Timor </dt><dd><em>[Coded [pt] (Portuguese Timor) before Jan. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>Indonesia</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>See the section "Changes in the Codes" below for more information about 
   these notes.</p>
   
<h3><u>Part II: Code Sequence</u></h3>
<p>In this part, the places and their codes are listed alphabetically by 
   the code. Only the code and the name of the place are given in this 
   part. Tracings or references for variant forms of the place names are 
   not included. For example:</p>
  
<dl compact="compact"><dt><strong>aru</strong></dt><dd>Arkansas</dd><dt><strong>as</strong></dt><dd>American Samoa</dd></dl>

<p>Discontinued codes are also listed in this part in their alphabetical 
   sequence. They are identified by a hyphen preceding the code. 
   For example:</p>
   
<dl compact="compact"><dt><strong>-ac</strong></dt><dd>Ashmore and Cartier Islands</dd></dl>

<h3><u>Part III: Regional Sequence</u></h3>

<p>In this part, the places and their codes are arranged in 12 groups 
   by region. The groups are:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>Africa</li> 
<li>Asia</li> 
<li> Atlantic Ocean</li>
<li> Australasia</li>
<li> Central America</li> 
<li> Europe</li>
<li> Indian Ocean</li> 
<li>North America</li>
<li> Pacific Ocean</li>
<li> South America</li>
<li> West Indies</li> 
<li>Other</li> 
</ul>

<p>The groups and the allocation of places to the groups are based on 
   the arrangement in the <em>MARC Code List for Geographic 
   Areas</em>. Within each group, the places are arranged 
   alphabetically by name. States of the United States, provinces 
   and territories of Canada, and divisions of the United Kingdom 
   are arranged alphabetically under the name of the parent 
   jurisdiction. Places with discontinued codes are not included in 
   this part.</p>

<h3><a name="co00chco">CHANGES IN THE CODES</a></h3>
<p>This list provides codes for countries and other places existing at the time 
   the list was compiled. The names of the places are also those current at the 
   time of compilation. Changes in the status of places as well as changes in names 
   are reflected in revised versions of this list. The following discusses how 
   such changes are presented in the list.</p>
  
<p>When a country has changed its name, the existing code is retained but the 
   new name is used and the earlier name is added as a reference. For example:</p>
    
<dl><dt><strong>Sri Lanka [ce]</strong></dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small></dt><dd>Ceylon</dd></dl>
</dd><dt>Ceylon </dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small></dt><dd>Sri Lanka</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>When it becomes necessary to change a code because the status of 
   an entity has changed, notes are added to the list to explain 
   the code changes and the date the change was made. If the old 
   code is discontinued, it is retained in the code list for 
   information.</p>
   
<p>The code for the latest name (the new code) should be used in all 
   new records. The old code, however, will not always be changed in 
   previously input records. Thus when using country codes to 
   retrieve records, if the code for the entity has changed since 
   the implementation of an earlier code list, it is advisable to 
   specify both the new and previously assigned (historical) codes 
   in the retrieval request if records coded prior to the 
   changes are desired.</p>
   
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Two entities previously coded separately 
   combine to form one entity, e.g., North Vietnam and South Vietnam 
   combined to become Vietnam. In this case, two existing codes are 
   discontinued, and a new code in addition to appropriate explanatory 
   notes are added.</p>
    
<dl><dt><strong>Vietnam [vm]</strong></dt><dd><em>[Coded [vn] (Vietnam, North) or [vs] (Vietnam, South) before Jan. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Democratic People's Republic of Vietnam</dd><dt></dt><dd>North Vietnam</dd><dt></dt><dd>South Vietnam</dd><dt></dt><dd>Vietnam, North</dd><dt></dt><dd>Vietnam, Republic of</dd><dt></dt><dd>Vietnam, South</dd></dl>
</dd><dt>Vietnam, North </dt><dd><em>[Coded [vn] (Vietnam, North) before Jan. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>Vietnam</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> One entity assigned a single code splits into 
   two or more separate entities. In this case, each of the new entities is 
   assigned a new code, and the code for the older combined entity is 
   discontinued. Notes are also added to each entity indicating the 
   date of the code change.</p>
    
<dl><dt>Gilbert and Ellice Islands</dt><dd><em>[Coded [gn] (Gilbert and Ellice Islands) before Oct. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small></dt><dd>Kiribati</dd><dt></dt><dd>Tuvalu</dd></dl>
</dd><dt><strong>Kiribati [gb]</strong> </dt><dd><em>[Coded [gn] (Gilbert and Ellice Islands) or [ln] (Central and Southern 
    Line Islands) before Oct. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Banaba</dd><dt></dt><dd>Birnie Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Canton Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Caroline Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Central and Southern Line Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Christmas Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Enderbury Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Fanning Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Flint Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Gardner Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Gilbert and Ellice Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Gilbert Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Hull Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Kiritimati</dd><dt></dt><dd>Line Islands (Southern)</dd><dt></dt><dd>Malden Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Manra Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>McKean Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nikomaroro Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Ocean Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Orona Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Phoenix Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Phoenix Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Rawaki</dd><dt></dt><dd>Starbuck Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Sydney Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Tabuarean Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Vostok Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Washington Island</dd></dl>
</dd><dt><strong>Tuvalu [tv]</strong></dt><dd><em>[Coded [gn] (Gilbert and Ellice Islands) before Oct. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Ellice Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Funafuti Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Gilbert and Ellice Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Niulakita Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nukufetau Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nukulaelae Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nukulailai Atoll</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nurakita Island</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> One entity previously assigned a code 
   is annexed by another entity which is already assigned a 
   different code, e.g., Sikkim was annexed by India. In this 
   case, the code for the annexed entity is discontinued, and 
   the annexed entity becomes a reference to the name of the entity 
   whose code is used after the change.</p>
    
<dl><dt><strong>India [ii]</strong> </dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Amindivi Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Andaman Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Daman</dd><dt></dt><dd>Diu</dd><dt></dt><dd>Goa</dd><dt></dt><dd>Laccadive Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Minicoy Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Nicobar Islands</dd><dt></dt><dd>Sikkim</dd></dl>
</dd><dt>Sikkim </dt><dd><em>[Coded [sk] (Sikkim) before Jan. 1978]</em> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>USE</small> </dt><dd>India</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> An entity which was assigned the code of 
   another entity splits off. In this case, the code for the 
   existing entity is retained, and a new code is created for the 
   entity which split off.</p> 
<dl><dt><strong>Mayotte [ot]</strong> </dt><dd><em>[Coded [cq] (Comoros) before July 1987]</em></dd><dt><strong>Comoros [cq]</strong> </dt><dd> 
<dl compact="compact"><dt><small>UF</small> </dt><dd>Anjouan Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Comores</dd><dt></dt><dd>Grande Comore Island</dd><dt></dt><dd>Moheli Island</dd></dl>
